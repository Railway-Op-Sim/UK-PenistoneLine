# Penistone Line, South and West Yorkshire

The Penistone Line runs between Sheffield and Huddersfield via Barnsley and Penistone, after where it gets its name. This simulation includes the section between just North of Meadowhall Interchange, and just South of Huddersfield.

This route has recently been upgraded, you can choose to download the earlier version by using the tick boxes on the right.

This route is designed to be a continuation of other simulations:
The "To Sheffield" continuation links with another continuation on Daniel Gill's Sheffield/SheffieldV2 routes. (https://www.railwayoperationsimulator.com/catalog/community-projects/united-kingdom/sheffield-v2)
The "To Leeds" continuation will link with the Wakefield route, which is currently in development.

## Simulation

There are two included timetables:
"PenistoneLine.ttb" was designed for the previous version of this route, as such, the timings may be a little bit out.
"PenistoneLineThu0700.ttb" is the newest timetable, it includes four hours of services, including a freight service at the beginning. It is based on real operations from Thursday 5th of October 2020.

### Tips for the simulation:

* The Sheffield to Huddersfield trains are designed to pass at Stocksmoor and Shepley.
* Take extra care on the single line section towards Huddersfield, it is advisable to make sure that the point is set at Stocksmoor is set in good time.

## Development

This project is open on the ROS GitHub (https://github.com/Railway-Op-Sim/UK-PenistoneLine) which means anyone can contribute to the project. You are welcome to contribute towards this route, may that be creating further timetables, or changing aspects of the route.

To aid in timetable creation, a txt file in included in the Documentation folder with the locations of the entry and exit portals, which you can copy directly into a timetable.

If you require any assistance in creation of a timetable or submitting it through GitHub, then visit the helpdesk channel on the ROS community Discord and we'll be happy to help.
