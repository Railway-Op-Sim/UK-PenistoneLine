# Penistone Line, South and West Yorkshire
This project represents the Penistone line, which runs between Sheffield and Huddersfield, although only the section between Meadowhall and Lockwood is simulated. This route is an upgraded version of Daniel Gill's original Penistone Line route which can be found [here](https://www.railwayoperationsimulator.com/catalog/community-projects/united-kingdom/penistone-line).
